The folder “caps” contains screenshots about ICMP/RTP/RIP dissection operated by the native dissectors for wireshark
and also contains dissections operated by the auto-generated dissectors (ICMPules/RTPules/RIPules) in order to compare them.
(There is a bug in “icmpules_dissection”, since Wireshark shows in the “Protocol” field “RTPules”, but the dissection is
done by ICMPules).

The “json” folder contains the json files used to define the protocols, in particular “proto.json” contains the template
that sets the rule to define a protocol.

The "Generator" folder contains the C++ code for the Generator's implementation.
To compile the code: just type "make"
To run the code: "./main File.json Output.lua" where File.json contains the definition of the protocol that we want to dissect and Output.lua contains the generated code in lua.

The “lua” folder contains the lua dissectors generated by the Generator.
